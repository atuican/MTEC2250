1. Personal Blackbox
	I find the personal blackbox to be a very useful idea, especially in how things run in the world nowadays; being able to document photos/videos of what's currently going on is very useful in the information age we're in. The fact that it's so small is also helpful, cause I'd hate to have to carry around a large device with me.

2. Bit Rocket
	The bit rocket is actually really cool, making use of hobby rockets to keep track of how many people are in a place. It can often be difficult to get a headcount (even with ticketing), so getting to individually count the number of people, and from a safe distance too, is essential for concerts and social gatherings.

3. Transparency Grenade
	Interesting idea for a surveillance system, but the design is not particularly great. It's a statement for sure, but bringing a sphere resembling a grenade to any public place would probably cause lots of issues. It could be misidentified as an improvised explosive too, which could cause more bad than good.
